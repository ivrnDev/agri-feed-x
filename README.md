# AGRIFEED X

Agrifeed X is an Internet of Things (IoT)-based project that automates the feeding process of hens or quails in a poultry farm. It includes an integrated mobile application that allows users to control feeding times through different modes such as smart feeding, time intervals, and scheduled feeding. The system features a food level sensor that measures the actual amount of feed in the container and incorporates an authentication mechanism to prevent security threats. It utilizes the ESP8266 microcontroller, which includes a Wi-Fi module, enabling connectivity with the mobile application over a network.
